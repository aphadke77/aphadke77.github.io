            <h2>The Scrum Process</h2>
            <p>Scrum is an agile framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products. It is designed for teams of ten or fewer members who break their work into goals that can be completed within timeboxed iterations, called sprints.</p>

                    <h3>What is Scrum?</h3>
                    <p>Scrum is a lightweight framework that helps people, teams and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems. It relies on empiricism and lean thinking to deal with uncertainty and solve problems creatively and productively.</p>
                    
                    <h3>The Scrum Framework</h3>
                    <p>Scrum defines three roles, five events, and three artifacts, all managed within iterations called Sprints. Sprints are fixed-length events of one month or less to create consistency.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Scrum Values</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Commitment:</strong> Team members personally commit to achieving the goals of the Scrum Team.</li>
                        <li><strong>Courage:</strong> Team members have courage to do the right thing and work on tough problems.</li>

                    <p>Scrum prescribes five events to create regularity and minimize the need for meetings not defined in Scrum:</p>
                    
                    <div class="card">
                        <h3>The Sprint</h3>
                        <p>The heartbeat of Scrum where ideas are turned into value. Fixed length events of one month or less. A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint.</p>
                        <p>During the Sprint:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal</li>
                            <li>Quality does not decrease</li>
                            <li>The Product Backlog is refined as needed</li>
                            <li>Scope may be clarified and renegotiated with the Product Owner as more is learned</li>

                        <h3>Sprint Planning</h3>
                        <p>Initiates the Sprint by laying out the work to be performed. Addresses three topics:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Why is this Sprint valuable?</strong> - The Product Owner proposes how the product could increase its value.</li>
                            <li><strong>What can be Done this Sprint?</strong> - Developers select items from the Product Backlog to include in the current Sprint.</li>
                            <li><strong>How will the chosen work get done?</strong> - For each selected Product Backlog item, the Developers plan the work necessary to create an Increment that meets the Definition of Done.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Timeboxed to a maximum of eight hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter.</p>

                    <div class="card">
                        <h3>Daily Scrum</h3>
                        <p>15-minute event for the Developers to synchronize activities and create a plan for the next 24 hours. Held at the same time and place every working day of the Sprint.</p>
                        <p>Developers can select whatever structure and techniques they want, as long as their Daily Scrum focuses on progress toward the Sprint Goal and produces an actionable plan for the next day of work.</p>
                        <p>Common questions include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What did I do yesterday that helped the Scrum Team meet the Sprint Goal?</li>
                            <li>What will I do today to help the Scrum Team meet the Sprint Goal?</li>
                            <li>Do I see any impediment that prevents me or the Scrum Team from meeting the Sprint Goal?</li>

                        <h3>Sprint Review</h3>
                        <p>The purpose is to inspect the outcome of the Sprint and determine future adaptations. The Scrum Team presents the results of their work to key stakeholders and progress toward the Product Goal is discussed.</p>
                        <p>During the event, the Scrum Team and stakeholders review what was accomplished in the Sprint and what has changed in their environment. Based on this information, attendees collaborate on what to do next.</p>
                        <p>The Sprint Review is a working session and should be timeboxed to a maximum of four hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter.</p>

                        <h3>Sprint Retrospective</h3>
                        <p>The purpose is to plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness. The Scrum Team inspects how the last Sprint went with regards to individuals, interactions, processes, tools, and their Definition of Done.</p>
                        <p>The Scrum Team discusses:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What went well during the Sprint</li>
                            <li>What problems it encountered</li>
                            <li>How those problems were (or were not) solved</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The Scrum Team identifies the most helpful changes to improve its effectiveness. The most impactful improvements are addressed as soon as possible, and may even be added to the Sprint Backlog for the next Sprint.</p>
                        <p>Timeboxed to a maximum of three hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter.</p>

                    <h3>Scrum Artifacts</h3>
                    <p>Scrum's artifacts represent work or value. They are designed to maximize transparency of key information. Each artifact contains a commitment to ensure it provides information that enhances transparency and focus.</p>
                    
                    <div class="card">
                        <h3>Product Backlog</h3>
                        <p>An emergent, ordered list of what is needed to improve the product. It is the single source of work undertaken by the Scrum Team.</p>
                        <p><strong>Commitment: Product Goal</strong> - The Product Goal describes a future state of the product which can serve as a target for the Scrum Team to plan against. The Product Goal is in the Product Backlog.</p>
                        <p>Product Backlog refinement is the act of breaking down and further defining Product Backlog items into smaller more precise items. This is an ongoing activity to add details, such as a description, order, and size.</p>

                        <h3>Sprint Backlog</h3>
                        <p>Composed of the Sprint Goal (why), the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint (what), and an actionable plan for delivering the Increment (how).</p>
                        <p><strong>Commitment: Sprint Goal</strong> - The Sprint Goal is the single objective for the Sprint. It provides flexibility in terms of the exact work needed to achieve it. The Sprint Goal also creates coherence and focus, encouraging the Scrum Team to work together rather than on separate initiatives.</p>
                        <p>The Sprint Backlog is a highly visible, real-time picture of the work that the Developers plan to accomplish during the Sprint in order to achieve the Sprint Goal.</p>

                        <h3>Increment</h3>
                        <p>An Increment is a concrete stepping stone toward the Product Goal. Each Increment is additive to all prior Increments and thoroughly verified, ensuring that all Increments work together.</p>
                        <p><strong>Commitment: Definition of Done</strong> - The Definition of Done is a formal description of the state of the Increment when it meets the quality measures required for the product. When a Product Backlog item meets the Definition of Done, an Increment is born.</p>
                        <p>The Definition of Done creates transparency by providing everyone a shared understanding of what work was completed as part of the Increment. If a Product Backlog item does not meet the Definition of Done, it cannot be released or even presented at the Sprint Review.</p>
